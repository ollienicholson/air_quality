    A Parameter in the OpenAQ platform is the type of particle or gaseous pollutant measured.

Currently OpenAQ supports the following Parameters:

- PM2.5 - Particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns
    - mass concentration (i.e. µg/m³)
    - count (i.e. particles/cm³ )
- PM4 - Particulate matter smaller than 4 microns
    - mass concentration (i.e. µg/m³)
    - count (i.e. particles/cm³ )
- PM10- Particulate matter smaller than 10 microns
    - mass concentration (i.e. µg/m³)
    - count (i.e. particles/cm³ )
- NO - Nitrogen Monoxide
- NO₂ - Nitrogen Dioxide
- CH₄ - Methane
    - Concentration (i.e. ppm)
- SO₂ - Sulfur Dioxide
- O₃ - Ozone
- CO - Carbon Monoxide
- BC - Black Carbon


DEFINITIONS

PM10 (Particulate Matter up to 10 micrometers):
Measures particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less.
Used to assess the level of larger particulate pollution in the air which can be inhaled into the lungs.

PM2.5 (Particulate Matter up to 2.5 micrometers):
Measures finer particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less.
These particles can penetrate deeper into the lungs and are a major health concern as they can affect heart and lung function.

O3 (Ozone):
Measures the concentration of ozone in the air in parts per million (ppm).
High levels of ozone can cause respiratory issues and other health problems, especially during warmer months when ozone can reach harmful levels.

PM1 (Particulate Matter up to 1 micrometer):
Measures the smallest particulate matter with a diameter of 1 micrometer or less.
These particles are capable of penetrating the deepest parts of the lungs and can enter the bloodstream, posing significant health risks.

Relative Humidity:
Measures the amount of moisture in the air as a percentage.
Humidity levels can influence the concentration and effects of other pollutants, as well as human comfort and health.

Temperature:
Measures the ambient air temperature in degrees Celsius.
Temperature can affect the chemical reactions of pollutants in the air and has a direct impact on the comfort and well-being of individuals.

UM003 (Ultrafine Particles of size 0.003 micrometers):
Measures ultrafine particles smaller than 0.003 micrometers in terms of particle count per cubic centimeter.
These ultrafine particles are significant as they represent the smallest and potentially most harmful particulates due to their ability to enter cellular membranes.
